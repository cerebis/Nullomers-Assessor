# Nullomers Assessor
<b>Nullomers Assessor:</b> a computational method for the statistical evaluation of Nullomers (a.k.a. Minimal Absent Words)

<b>Description:</b> Nullomers Assessor is a computational method for the evaluation and classification of a list of Nullomers as 'significantly absent' depending on the distribution of residues in a specific genome/proteome. The underlying method is based on 4 different transition probabilities (orders) of Markov chain stohastic model. The method is able to assess either nucleotide sequences or amino acid oligomers. Three different statictical correction method are provided with this version.
