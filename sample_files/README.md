# File formats and content:

  <b>*Mycoplasma_genitalium.fna*</b>
       Modified two-line FASTA format of the nucleotide sequences corresponding to  
       Mycoplasma genitalium bacterium. The original file has been downloaded from

  <b>*Mycoplasma_genitalium.out*</b>
       List of nullomers up to 14 nucleotides long from Mycoplasma genitalium 
       bacterium. Nullomers have been calculated using MAW software script

# Important note:

The files on this directory are provided for testing purposes. 

*Mycoplasma genitalium* outputs **no** significant results regardless statistical 
correction method. *Pseudomonas fluorescens* presents significant missing motifs
either by selecting BONF, TARONE, or FDR method.
