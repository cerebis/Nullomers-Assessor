# File formats and content:

  <b>*Mycoplasma_genitalium.fna*</b>
       One-header one-line FASTA file of nucleotide sequences from the   
       Mycoplasma genitalium bacterium. The original file has been retrieved 
       from the following link:
       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/Mycoplasma_genitalium/representative/ 
	   
  <b>*Mycoplasma_genitalium.out*</b>
       List of nullomers up to 14 nucleotides from the Mycoplasma genitalium 
       bacterium. Nullomers have been calculated using the MAW software script
       https://github.com/solonas13/maw
	   
  <b>*Pseudomonas fluorescens.fna*</b>
       One-header one-line FASTA file of nucleotide sequences from the 
       Pseudomonas fluorescens bacterium. The original file has been retrieved 
       from the following link:
       ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/Pseudomonas_fluorescens/representative/GCF_900475215.1_42727_B01 
	   
  <b>*Pseudomonas fluorescens.out*</b>
       List of nullomers up to 14 nucleotides long from the Pseudomonas fluorescens
       bacterium. Nullomers have been calculated using the MAW software script

# Important note:

The files on this directory are provided for testing purposes. 

*Mycoplasma genitalium* outputs **no** significant results regardless statistical 
correction method. *Pseudomonas fluorescens* presents significant missing motifs
either by selecting BONF, TARONE, or FDR method.
