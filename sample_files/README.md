  <b>*Mycoplasma_genitalium.fna*</b>
       One-header one-line FASTA file of nucleotide sequences from the   
       Mycoplasma genitalium bacterium. The original file has been retrieved

  <b>*Mycoplasma_genitalium.out*</b>
       List of nullomers up to 14 nucleotides from the Mycoplasma genitalium 
       bacterium. Nullomers have been calculated using the MAW software script
